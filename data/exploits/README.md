# Exploits Library Storage

This directory stores user-submitted smart contract exploits from The Observer's analysis system.

## Structure

Each exploit is stored as two files:
- `{id}.json` - Metadata (title, description, severity, etc.)
- `{id}.sol` - The Solidity exploit code

## Format

### JSON File (`{id}.json`)
```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "title": "Exploit Title",
  "description": "Description of the exploit",
  "code": "// Solidity code",
  "targetContract": "0x... (optional)",
  "vulnerabilityType": "Reentrancy | Integer Arithmetic | etc.",
  "severity": "low | medium | high | critical",
  "author": "Author name or Anonymous",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "submittedAt": "ISO timestamp"
}
```

### Solidity File (`{id}.sol`)
Contains the full exploit code as submitted by the user.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/exploits` - Submit new exploit
- `GET /api/exploits` - List all exploits (with optional filters)
- `GET /api/exploits/stats/summary` - Get statistics
- `GET /api/exploits/:id` - Get specific exploit
- `DELETE /api/exploits/:id` - Delete exploit

## Security Note

This is a local development storage system. For production:
- Implement proper authentication
- Add rate limiting
- Sanitize all inputs
- Use a proper database
- Implement backup strategies
